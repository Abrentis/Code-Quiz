# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

People benefit from certain methods of learning more than others. Some like to test themselves by recalling information from memory with no outside resources helping or prompting them; others thrive on visual recognitions when being presented with multiple choices to an answer. I find that this latter process is very effective in learning vocabulary for words, so I created this website with the goal of testing my knowledge of fundamental JavaScript concepts so that I can compare my progress to my peers. While simple as it may be, the process of designing questions and answers helps reinforce my understanding of content and my ability to write dense terminology in my own words.

## Usage



Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
